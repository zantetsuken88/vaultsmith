What
----

vaultsmith is a tool for provisioning instances of Hashicorp Vault, for 
example by setting up roles and access permissions. The goal is to support a 
_declarative_ style of configuration, i.e. the configuration reflects the 
final state, and executions are idempotent.

This project is under active development, and third party contributions are 
most welcome.


Why not use [puppet|chef|ansible|$myConfigManagementTool]?
--------------------------------------------------------
We need something lightweight and simple, that doesn't allow users to do 
anything other than provision vault.
